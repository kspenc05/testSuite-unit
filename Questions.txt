Question #1. 3 variables. The number of input files,
             number of words to look up, and
             the number of possible phoneme sequences.

Question #2: the partitions of input files would be 0 - 1, 1 - positive infinity.
             the partitions of the number of words to look up,
             would be: 0 - 1, 1 - positive infinity.
             the partitions for the number of phoneme sequences would be 0 - 1,
             and 1 - positive infinity.

Question #3: The normal values for each variable would be:
             input files = 1.
             number of words to look up = 1<->149,999
             number of phoneme sequences = 1<->positive infinity
                 
Question #4: The robust values for each variable would be: 
             number of input files = 0, 2, 3
             number of words to look up = 0, 2.
             number of phoneme sequences = 0, 2.
